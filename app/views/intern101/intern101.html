              <h1><em>Dress Code</em></h1>
                <p>Worried about what to wear on your first day? Well worry not! This guide is here to help. In general, office attire at JPMorgan Chase Tampa locations is business casual, but be sure to check in with your manager just in case.</p>

                <h2><em>Women</em></h2>
                <p>You always want to make sure that your attire in the workplace conveys a sense of competence and credibility, but you also want to ensure that your personality is evident as well.  From the moment you walk into the office, people will begin to perceive you based on the way you dress.</p>
  
                <p class="attire-img"><img src ="http://www.jelyssanne.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/touch-casual-dresses-dress-codes-womens-page-001-1024x630-women-business-casual-dress.jpg"></p>
   
                <p>Business Professional attire is the most professional type of dress code. This is something you would wear if you were meeting the CEO of your company, or if you were presenting in a big meeting. You should wear either a pant suit, a skirt suit, or a dress with a blazer. The suit jacket sleeves should hit at the end of your wrists without overlapping onto your hands. Make sure that if you are wearing a skirt or a dress, it is no shorter than the tops of your knees. Either heels or flats are appropriate. This attire is not typically seen around the office, but you will be required to dress Business Professional for your first day!</p>
 
                <p>Business Casual is typically what you will see people wearing around the office. Pencil skirts, dress pants, and dresses with a blazer are all acceptable. Make sure that the shirt you are wearing has sleeves, and if it doesn’t just wear a sweater or a blazer over the top. Heels or flats are also appropriate, and jewelry is generally up to personal preference. If you have any doubts, just dress conservatively the first day, and see what other people are wearing!</p>

                <p>Casual Fridays occur every Friday here at JPMorgan Chase. You will see people wearing jeans and t-shirts with sneakers, amongst other things. You can wear this too! Just dress a little nicer for the first casual Friday to get a feel for what the people in your office are wearing. Also, your jeans cannot have holes in them. Make sure to remember that you are starting to build a professional reputation and are still in a work environment on Friday’s and while it is okay to express yourself keep these things in mind while deciding what to wear on Friday! </p>

              <div class="col-md-12 men-wrapper">
                <h2><em>Men</em></h2>
 
                <p>You too want to make sure that your attire in the workplace conveys your competence and credibility. When you meet someone for the first time, they will perceive you based on the way you dress.</p>
 
                <p class="attire-img"><img src ="http://macroccs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/dress-codes-mens-page-001.jpg"></p>

                <p> Business Professional is the most professional type of attire. This is what you would wear when meeting a company CEO or making a presentation. For men, it is very simple: wear a matching suit. It is best to go with a dark color or a pinstriped suit, and then pair it with a white or a solid colored shirt. If a tie is required, make sure that it is conservative in design. Make sure that your suit is well fitted, and remember that when you are standing, you need to button the top button of your jacket. While sitting, make sure to unbutton it. Again, this attire is not very common at JPMorgan Chase Tampa office locations, but you will be required to wear Business Professional for your first day or other events throughout the internship.</p>

                <p> Business Casual is the typical office attire here. Jackets are still preferred, but not required. Khakis, slacks, button-downs, and polos are all acceptable. Make sure that your slacks are well-fitted and not too tight, and that your button-down shirts are not too long in the sleeves.</p>

                <p> Casual Fridays are every Friday here at the JPMorgan Chase Tampa offices. You will see people wearing jeans and t-shirts with sneakers, amongst other things. You can wear this as well, just dress a little nicer for the first casual Friday to get a feel for what the people in your office are wearing. It is okay to express yourself on casual Friday’s, but keep in mind you are still in a workplace setting and still building a professional reputation. </p>
